## Why?

I discovered *-or currently discovering, depending on when you're reading this*, the subject of monitoring during my last internship before officially becoming an engineer. I found the subject very interesting! Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to learn it properly, simply because my internship tasks were time-sensitive and I had to deliver working software: more often than not, **"making-it-work"** type-tasks took over the **"me-taking-the-time-to-actually-understand-everything-I'm-doing-and-learning"** type-tasks...

I am aware that this is a normal and intergral part of being an engineer: the value we provide is the working software we deliver. As long as the quality doesn't suffer, we must always be value-driven. Nevertheless, I can't say this wasn't frustrating. Not having the time to learn the ins-and-outs of a subject that interests you...

## ... Hence this repo!

This is me taking the time to teach myself the theoritical part of the subject of monitoring and documenting it. Everyone on the internet recommands this book for getting started, so this is my starting point. I am guessing that as I am going through this book, I'll get the itch to put in practice what I am learning. If I don't have the opportunity to do so for my internship, this repo will quickly become a contrived project. 
Anyhow... Let the journey begin :)
