# It's about time

I started coding 5 years ago. I've never done a side project. It's about time.

It's not that I don't enjoy coding -it's quite the opposite! It's just that my goals were not necessitating me to do so.

Before even starting the university, I already had the goal to get into ENSIMAG (the engineering school I'm graduating from).
So I studied hard, and fair enough, two years later, I got in.

Once at ENSIMAG, I didn't really set new 'carrieer' goals. So ... nothing happened. *"Failing to plan is planning to fail"* as a dear friend of mine would always say.

Now that I'm starting a new page in my carrier, I have a new goal: I really want to be a good software engineer. Like... a pro, a competent one, that other pros/good software engineers know they can rely on to get stuff done the right way. Not the kind of guy that you know you'll have to clean every piece of code he wrote once his done (I'm not saying that I'm him, it's just an example, you get the idea)...

But, On a more concrete level, what does being a good software engineer mean? I think it means many things, and I'm not sure I have my own set-in-stone definition yet. But, what is definitely set in stone, is that I want to be good. And to become good, I might as well start acting like I'm already good.

And what would a good software engineer would do?
Well for starters, he would be doing side projects :)

It's about time!
